# Introduction
For our dataset, we chose to use a dataset from Kaggle that displays each country’s life expectancy, along with various features such as GDP, BMI, alcohol consumption, immunization coverage of certain diseases, etc. We chose this dataset because we wanted to predict a country’s life expectancy based on the other features. Having a good predictive model for this dataset would allow us to know which features have the most impact on life expectancy. This could have an impact on how people make decisions about their health in their everyday lives and could influence a country’s healthcare policies.
