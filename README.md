## Preprocessing Steps

We plan to normalize the columns in our dataframe excluding the "Country" column using min max normalization because the data doesn't appear to be normally distributed. We do not need to deal with missing data because we have no missing data. We also will remove outliers. 

## What we did for Preprocessing


1: Finish Major Preprocessing

Finish major preprocessing, this includes scaling and/or transforming your data, imputing your data, encoding your data, feature expansion, Feature expansion (example is taking features and generating new features by transforming via polynomial, log multiplication of features).

2: Train your first model

3: Evaluate your model and compare training vs. test error

4: Answer the questions: Where does your model fit in the fitting graph? and What are the next models you are thinking of and why?

5: Update your README.md to include your new work and updates you have all added. Make sure to upload all code and notebooks. Provide links in your README.md

6. Conclusion section: What is the conclusion of your 1st model? What can be done to possibly improve it?

Please make sure preprocessing is complete and your first model has been trained. If you are doing supervised learning include example ground truth and predictions for train, validation and test.
